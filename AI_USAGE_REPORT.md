# AI Usage Report - Banking REST Service Development

## Overview
This document tracks the AI-driven development process for the banking REST service project, demonstrating effective use of AI tools to accelerate development while maintaining code quality and best practices.

## AI Tools Used
- **Primary Tool**: GitHub Copilot (VS Code Extension)
- **Development Environment**: VS Code with AI assistance
- **Approach**: Structured prompt engineering with iterative refinement

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Project Initialization and Architecture (Completed)

#### Initial Structured Prompt
```
Create a minimal Java Spring Boot banking REST service using SQLite with the following specifications:

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Spring Boot 3.x with Maven
- Dependencies: Web, Data JPA, Validation, Security, SQLite driver, Lombok
- Database: SQLite with Hibernate 6
- Authentication: JWT-based security
- Containerization: Docker with Docker Compose

DOMAIN MODEL:
- AccountHolder: Customer entity with accounts relationship
- Account: Bank account with holder and transactions
- Transaction: Financial operations (renamed to avoid SQL conflicts)
- Card: Payment cards linked to accounts

PROJECT STRUCTURE:
- Complete package organization (model, repository, service, controller, dto, config)
- Comprehensive error handling and validation
- Security configuration with JWT
- Docker deployment setup
- Testing framework integration

OUTPUT FORMAT:
- Complete working project with all files
- Docker Compose for easy deployment
- Proper Git repository structure
```

**AI Response Quality**: Excellent - Generated complete project structure with all required components

#### Iterative Refinement Prompts

**Database Configuration Optimization**:
```
ISSUE: SQLite compatibility with Hibernate 6
CONTEXT: Custom SQLiteDialect causing compilation errors
SOLUTION REQUEST: Update to use Hibernate 6 built-in SQLite dialect
EXPECTED OUTCOME: Clean compilation and successful schema generation
```

**Entity Relationship Refinement**:
```
PROBLEM: "transaction" is a reserved word in SQLite
CONTEXT: JPA entity mapping failure
STRUCTURED FIX:
1. Rename table to "bank_transaction" using @Table annotation
2. Maintain entity name as "Transaction" for code clarity
3. Verify all relationships remain intact
```

**Docker Deployment Troubleshooting**:
```
DEPLOYMENT ISSUE: Maven build failures in Docker container
DEBUG CONTEXT: 
- Local builds successful
- Docker environment differences
RESOLUTION REQUEST:
1. Analyze Dockerfile for dependency issues
2. Fix build process for containerized environment
3. Ensure successful application startup
```

### Phase 2: Implementation Strategy (In Progress)

#### Structured Endpoint Development Prompt
```
NEXT PHASE: Complete REST API implementation based on Phase 1 foundation

ENDPOINT REQUIREMENTS:
1. Authentication endpoints (/auth/signup, /auth/login)
2. Account management (/api/accounts, /api/accounts/{id})
3. Transaction processing (/api/transactions, /api/transfer)
4. Card management (/api/cards)
5. Statement generation (/api/statements)

IMPLEMENTATION STANDARDS:
- JWT security on all protected endpoints
- Comprehensive input validation
- Proper HTTP status codes
- Error handling with meaningful messages
- Transaction atomicity for money transfers

TESTING REQUIREMENTS:
- Unit tests for service layer
- Integration tests for controllers
- Security testing for authentication
- Database transaction testing
```

## AI-Assisted Problem Solving Examples

### 1. SQLite Reserved Word Conflict
**Challenge**: Entity named "Transaction" conflicted with SQLite reserved word
**AI Prompt**: 
```
Analyze SQLite reserved words conflict with JPA entity naming.
Provide solution that maintains clean code while avoiding database conflicts.
```
**Solution**: Used `@Table(name = "bank_transaction")` annotation
**Outcome**: Clean entity naming with database compatibility

### 2. Hibernate 6 Dialect Issues
**Challenge**: Custom SQLiteDialect causing compilation errors
**AI Guidance**: 
```
Research Hibernate 6 SQLite dialect options.
Recommend modern approach replacing custom dialect implementation.
```
**Resolution**: Switched to `org.hibernate.community.dialect.SQLiteDialect`
**Result**: Successful schema generation and application startup

### 3. Docker Containerization
**Challenge**: Maven build process in Docker environment
**Structured Approach**:
```
Design multi-stage Dockerfile for Spring Boot application:
1. Maven build stage with dependency resolution
2. Runtime stage with minimal JRE
3. Proper file copying and permissions
4. Health check implementation
```
**Achievement**: Successful containerized deployment

## Prompt Engineering Techniques Used

### 1. Contextual Problem Framing
- Always provided current state and desired outcome
- Included relevant error messages and logs
- Specified technical constraints and requirements

### 2. Structured Solution Requests
- Broke complex problems into discrete steps
- Requested specific code patterns and implementations
- Asked for explanations of design decisions

### 3. Iterative Refinement
- Started with broad architectural guidance
- Refined specific implementation details
- Validated solutions before moving to next component

## Areas Where AI Excelled

1. **Architecture Design**: Generated comprehensive project structure
2. **Dependency Management**: Correctly configured Maven dependencies
3. **Entity Modeling**: Created proper JPA relationships and mappings
4. **Docker Configuration**: Provided working containerization setup
5. **Problem Diagnosis**: Quickly identified SQLite compatibility issues

## Manual Intervention Required

1. **Environment-Specific Configuration**: Local path adjustments for Windows development
2. **Git Repository Management**: Manual git operations for version control
3. **Testing and Validation**: Manual verification of application startup and functionality
4. **Documentation Review**: Human oversight of generated documentation quality

## Challenges and AI Solutions

### Challenge 1: Database Schema Generation
**Issue**: Initial schema creation with complex relationships
**AI Solution**: Provided proper JPA annotations and relationship mappings
**Result**: Clean database schema with foreign key constraints

### Challenge 2: Security Configuration
**Issue**: JWT implementation complexity
**AI Solution**: Generated complete security configuration with token handling
**Result**: Working authentication framework ready for endpoint protection

### Challenge 3: Development Environment Setup
**Issue**: Docker compose configuration for development workflow
**AI Solution**: Created development-friendly compose setup with volume mounting
**Result**: Seamless local development with containerized database
